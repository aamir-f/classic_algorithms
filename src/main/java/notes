===============
1.) Data Structure is a way to organize data in a way that enables it to be processed in an efficent time.
2.) Algorithm is a set of rules to be followed to solve a problem.
3.) Types of Data Structuresd: a.) Primitive (Int, Long etc) b.) Non-Primitive i.) physical DS (Array, LinkedList: implemented standalone
	and they are physically present in RAM) ii.) Logical DS, dependent on Physical DS for their implementation e.g stack, queue, tree, graph.

	DS can be linear(array, linkedlist, stack,queue), non-linear(trees, graphs)

4.) Iteration is space and time efficent as compared to Recusion...Recusion make easy to code than iteration...
